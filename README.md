# FernflowerUI
## Just a Java Decomplier with GUI and Decomplie Core called Fernflower

### 3.1 Update

Now we have changed our User Interface into MDI.You can view multiple .java files at the same time.
We've also added Shell Tree.It's just like the tree view of Windows Explorer.And you can decomplie the .jar files through the shell tree's popup menu.
You can also do what Windows Explorer allows through the popup menu. 

Fixed:We've fixed some bugs of Syntax HighLight.Now the error because of the '\0' character in the .java files won't occur to you.

It's like JD-GUI,which is one of the most famous Java Decompliers,but maybe it has the better quality of decompliing .jar files,
 the slower decompling speed, and the worse UI.

## Also,we have released on [Baidu Tieba](https://tieba.baidu.com/p/5357968894?pid=113035827659&cid=0&red_tag=1675627321#113035827659) and [McBBS](http://www.mcbbs.net/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=773809&page=1#pid12656797) in China.
