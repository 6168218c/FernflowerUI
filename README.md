## What's FernflowerUI?
It was used to enter the long and boring command line when it was first created.(Yes,just like a BATCH file)
Then several features were added, such as decompile logging,syntax highlight and some other stuff.
It has updated to version 3.4.2 so far,which is a result of 1.5 year's hard(lazy) work.

## Features
FernflowerUI can:

- [x] Help you decompile Jar files,as well as Class files.(JRE required.)

- [x] Help you decompile classes inside a jar file sperately.

- [ ] Help you modify the decompiled code.
Really bad at syntax highlight, so code editing is not supported.

- [x] Search for some contents in Current Block,Current Document,All Open Documents,Current Package and The Whole Jar with the FindText dialog box.You can press Control to make the dialog box transparent.

- [x] Save the Jar file by clicking the Save button.
