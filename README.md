## What's FernflowerUI?
It was used to enter the long and boring command line when it was first created.(Yes,just like a BATCH file)
Then several features were added, such as decompile logging,syntax highlight and some other stuff.
It has updated to version 3.4.2 so far,which is a result of 1.5 year's hard(lazy) work.
