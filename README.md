# FernflowerUI
## Just a Java Decomplier with GUI and Decomplie Core called Fernflower

### 3.1 Update

Now we have changed our User Interface into MDI.You can view multiple .java files at the same time.
We've also added Shell Tree.It's just like the tree view of Windows Explorer.And you can decomplie the .jar files through the shell tree's popup menu.
You can also do what Windows Explorer allows through the popup menu. 

现在我们重制了界面,升级至MDI.现在可以同时浏览多个.java文件
我们也增加了文件夹视图，就是Windows资源管理器的树视图,现在文件夹视图的右键菜单提供了Windows资源管理器的所有功能和直接反编译功能

Fixed:We've fixed some bugs of Syntax HighLight.Now the error because of the '\0' character in the .java files won't occur to you.
修复:我们修复了一些关于语法高亮的bug,现在由于空字符而产生的错误不会再发生了

It's like JD-GUI,which is one of the most famous Java Decompliers,but maybe it has the better quality of decompliing .jar files,
 the slower decompling speed, and the worse UI.

## Besides,we have released on [Baidu Tieba](https://tieba.baidu.com/p/5357968894?pid=113035827659&cid=0&red_tag=1675627321#113035827659) and [McBBS](http://www.mcbbs.net/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=773809&page=1#pid12656797) in China.
