# FernflowerUI
## Just a Java Decomplier with GUI and Decomplie Core called Fernflower

<<<<<<< HEAD
### 3.0 Update
Now we add the use of viewing the classes in a .jar file.
It's like JD-GUI,which is one of the most famous Java Decompliers,but maybe it has the better quality of decompliing .jar files.
We have also improved the speed of downloading fernflower.jar
=======
### 2.3 Update
Now we use std::thread and std::future to create threads to improve the speed of reading the Decomplie Log.

Fixed:While you are downloading fernflower.jar,if your net connection is not strong enough , it won't seem to be "No response
".
