# FernflowerUI
## Just a Java Decomplier with GUI and Decomplie Core called Fernflower

### 3.0 Update

Now we add the use of viewing the classes in a .jar file.And now it supports Syntax HighLight just like Dev-C++.

It's like JD-GUI,which is one of the most famous Java Decompliers,but maybe it has the better quality of decompliing .jar files.
We have also improved the speed of downloading fernflower.jar

## Also,we have released on [Baidu Tieba](https://tieba.baidu.com/p/5357968894?pid=113035827659&cid=0&red_tag=1675627321#113035827659) and [McBBS](http://www.mcbbs.net/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=773809&page=1#pid12656797) in China.
